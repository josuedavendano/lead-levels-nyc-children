# Lead Levels in NYC Children

By: Sokol Sheri, Josue Avendano, Daryl Tobierre, Fjodi Hyzoti

Summary

For this project, our group decided to explore lead-levels in New York City. The question that prompted this research was do lead-levels in certain boroughs in New York influence elevated lead-levels in children. In particular, we were curious to see if kids obtain these elevated blood-lead levels by contracting them from park-fountains in their area. The three datasets that we used for this research were:

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Children-Under-6-yrs-with-Elevated-Blood-Lead-Leve/tnry-kwh5

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Free-Residential-at-the-tap-Lead-and-Copper-Data/k5us-nav4

https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Drinking-Fountains/ph76-k6qa

The first link is a dataset for kids under 6 years old with elevated blood-lead levels. This dataset includes geographic locations of each kid. The second link shows lead and copper levels by geographic locations. The third link shows drinking fountains in the city. Overall, our research is looking to find a relationship between all datasets. After completing our research, we have found reason to believe that there is a direct relationship between water fountains, high-blood lead levels in children under 6, and lead-levels in residential households that all point to particular areas having a direct impact on children's blood-lead levels.
